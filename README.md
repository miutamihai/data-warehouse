## Clone the repository

### Clone the repository using Git
Use these steps to clone the data-warehouses-starter repository using `git` tool. Cloning allows you to work on your files locally.

1. You’ll see the clone button under the **Source** heading. Click that button.
2. Click Copy to clipboard button to copy the `git clone ...` command to clipboard
3. Create a directory on your local machine that will be the home of your future projects
4. Open a **Command Prompt**/**Terminal** window in the directory you just created and paste the clipboard content there<br>
`git clone https://danielpop@bitbucket.org/danielpop/data-warehouses-starter.git`
5. Hit `ENTER` and there you go: a new folder containing a clone of this repository is created on your local machine. 
6. Change to that directory `cd data-warehouses-starter` and move to the next section (Build the project using Gradle Wrapper)

### Clone the repository from a ZIP archive
If you don't yet have Git, and don't want/need/like it, just download the repository as a ZIP archive 
(click Downloads on the left panel and then Download repository) and unpack it locally. Move to the next section.

## Build the project using Gradle Wrapper

Run `$ gradlew build` (under Linuxes) or `> gradlew.bat build` (under Windows) to build the project. This will
 download Gradle (if not already on your system) and will build the project.
